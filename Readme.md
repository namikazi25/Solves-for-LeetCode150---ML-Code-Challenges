# Coding Solutions Repository

Welcome to my coding solutions repository! This collection showcases my approach to solving various algorithmic and machine learning challenges. The primary focus is on the LeetCode150 problems, which are well-regarded for enhancing problem-solving skills and coding proficiency.

## LeetCode150 Solutions

In the `LeetCode150` directory, you will find solutions to a selection of algorithmic problems that cover a range of topics, including:

- **Two Sum**: A classic problem that demonstrates the use of nested loops and conditionals to find pairs of numbers that sum to a target value.
- **Contains Duplicate**: This solution efficiently checks for duplicate elements in a list using set data structures.
- **Valid Anagram**: A straightforward implementation that compares two strings to determine if they are anagrams by sorting their characters.

Each solution is implemented in Python and follows best practices for readability and efficiency.

## Deep-ML Challenges

The `ML Code Challenges (Deep-ML)` directory contains solutions to various machine learning problems. These challenges are designed to test and improve skills in data manipulation, model evaluation, and algorithm implementation.

## Getting Started

To explore the solutions, simply clone this repository and navigate to the respective directories. Each file contains the problem statement, followed by the implemented solution.
